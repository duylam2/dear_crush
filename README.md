Description

dear [crush] is a stealth game where you try to reach through the different checkpoints without being seen. In this game, you play as a teenage boy who is having a huge crush on the girl next (classroom's) door, and you plan to confess your feelings through a letter. However, peer pressure is a fairly real thing, so you don't want your classmates to find out you're doing this cheesy thing because that will be embarrassing.

This is an autobiographical game started in the class 'Intermediate Game Development' as a midterm project. It was then revamped for better performance and introduce new mechanics.
