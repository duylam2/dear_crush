I must deliver this letter to my crush, but no one must see me.
[crush] is probably still in her classroom, 1B.
Hmm, how can I know which table is hers again? I should reread my letter.
She's not here. What is this, someone gave her a note? It reads "meet me at the lecture hall at break time".
The capsule at the corner, is that her?
[crush], who is this guy? He confessed his feelings to you?? Just 5 minutes ago??? But, but...
